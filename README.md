# ONAP_LAB
This project provides steps and artifacts for building ONAP by OOM and Integration Projects around it such as ESON.

It is based on [ OOM User Guide ](http://onap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submodules/oom.git/docs/oom_user_guide.html)

## Requirements

- Running on Ubuntu Xenial (Cores=2 Mem=8G Root-Disk=30G)
- This project has tested it in OpenStack RHOSP 10
- Please note that we mount an extra volume and use as default for Docker storage.
- Make sure resources as flavor, image, SSH Keys, Security Groups referenced in the artifacts exist in the selected region.
- Youâ€™ll need OpenStack CLI installed.
- More minimum requirements can be found examining the Playbooys.
- All use cases required ONAP Base Deployment ( unless indicated at sub-project section )

## ONAP Base Deployment

Source your authentication credentials:

Execute:

	$ source keystonerc
  
Source your authentication credentials:

Execute:

	$ openstack stack create -t deploy/oom_onap.yaml --parameters "AnsibleRepository=https://github.com/moffzilla/ONAP_LAB.git; AnsiblePlaybook=deploy/site.yaml;OOMTemplate=minimal.cfg.j2" ONAP-stack

You can replace the following default settings:

	KeyName": "ONAP"
	
	AnsibleRepository": https://github.com/moffzilla/ONAP_LAB.git"
	
	AnsiblePlaybook: "deploy/site.yaml" 
  
    OOMTemplate: "minimal.cfg.j2"
  
You can also create the stack at the Horizon Dashboard

Use the command 

	openstack stack list 

to verify that the stack was created for the instance.

Display:

Execute nova list to view list virtual machine instances and obtain the virtual machine instance UUID for the virtul machine created by the heat stack template.

The command openstack server show <instance UUID> will provide details about the newly deployed instance.
        
    openstack server show 6a4ca385-a901-48bb-8a51-eb301108ce13

You can see the public IP and FQDN

Remove

	openstack stack delete ONAP-stack
	
You can also delete the stack at the Horizon Dashboard
